# Final Project My Day

Most of us have some kind of social media app where we spend time, like Facebook or Instagram and they are sometimes perceived as being superficial. We see benefits in connecting with friends and family and sharing our everyday life but there is seldom or maybe more closer to the truth, never any space for honest reflections. 
We believe that it's essential for our wellbeing to reflect on a daily basis, so we created a web application that offers a space for inner reflection. We call it My Day and it is our version of a digital journal.

## View it live (updating the backend at the moment)


## Tools and techniques

We used these tools and techniques:
- Login and registration forms with authorization/tokens
- Frontend in React 
- Backend in Node.js
- MongoDB database
- Navigation using React Router
- Should work in Chrome and Safari
- It is responsive and works on mobile, tablet and Iphone

The challenge we had was to combine the saved message with data to an existing picture fetched from an external API. 
Initially we could see the data in the database but it wasn't visible in the frontend. When we managed to combine these two techniques, we were able to both save and post the data together with the picture. 

## The vision

We want people to see this as an effortless task, not something that takes too much time. In order to do so we limited the questions so that it only takes a couple of minutes to fill in the journal, but still adds true value to the users. 

The vision if we had more time
- Build our own API with quotes. 
- Would be to build the site starting with one initial question that leads you further on to a certain type of questions, depending on your state of mind that day. In other words customized questions reflection your initial answer. If you're feeling sad, some comforting words or if you're happy, some exciting quotes or a challenge ie. pay a stranger a nice compliment.

- Personalize the page with optional backgrounds
- More questions to the desktop view
- Adding an animation after completing the reflection to inspire and as a positive boost
